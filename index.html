<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Rather a peaceful minded man who wanted nothing more than to live in the quiet places most people wouldn't even think or want since life is always expensive
  But I say differnet, It really depends on where in the world and it'll come once thingshave settled, time and patience is on
  everyone's side if used wisely
</p>

<p>Video Gamer (Yeah I know how "amazing" haha But some of the time I do tend to read because I need something to stimulate my mind
  instead of watching television eventhough cable television is so bland and useless(Why am I bothering to spend money on cable I'll never know)
  But video games alone has entranced me in to playing something new in life and give my parents a hard time (some of the time)
  But I'll admit video gaming isn't whta is used to be, SO Since i made a commitment to wanting to go back into the gaming ring 
  I decided I want to act upon bringing back classics to give the newer generation something to strive for.
</p>

<p>Wishing videro gaming was how it was many years ago where people came and enjoyed each others company as well as enjoy the absolute S&^T out of somehting that 
  brings smiles to them into knowing they played something worth while is a plus, while giving insight
  into how these games have brought many other companies to do the same into making their own as well for the public.

  <h1>The Best Movies According to Algenis</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>My thought process when this movie came out was a bit random because at the time I thought it was fake than realizing it was a childhood dream of watching this movie and finding out it passed all my expectations as a pre-teen at the time.</p>
<h3>Home Alone - Lost in New York</h3>
<p>I can only imagine a burgler coming into someones house and finding out many boobie-traps(haha get it XD) would be out of the question, than it goes on into producing amazing features of how to eleminitae your enemies in a more comedic "Child- friendly" sort of way.</p>
<h3>Death Race 2009</h3>
<p>One of the Very few films i Thoroughly enjoyed being many years into the future where the world has become so obselete that the prison system uses in-mates for entertainment and earning their freedom after winning five races.</p>
